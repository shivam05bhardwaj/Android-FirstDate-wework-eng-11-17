Android-FirstDate
=================

First dates are awkward. But they don't have to be... What if you had a super cool android app that could manage the scheduling of your first date, leaving you to focus on witty banter and maintaining your minty fresh breath.  Well that's exactly what we're going to create.  

## Structure

Let the tests be your guide for what public methods need to be implemented.  But here's a bit of over arching info.  You should create a FirstDate model class that is constructed with an `ArrayList<String>`.  The ArrayList is a list of date strings that you and your date are available.  We should be able to use our class to do the following: 

- Schedule a date 
- Cancel a date
- Find out if a date is scheduled 
- Get the date of our scheduled date in case we forget... 
- Get a `Date` object when we pass in a string 

Be crazy TDD ninja's and figure out how the app should be structured using the tests, but since that can be weird and ambiguous sometimes just ask if you need any more guidance.
